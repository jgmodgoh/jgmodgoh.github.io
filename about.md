####Hi! My name is John Goh and I enjoy programming during my free time. 

***

I was born and raised in sunny [Singapore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore) where I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/). In 2008 I moved to New York City to pursue a Master of Science in Financial Engineering and graduated from [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/) a year later. I now live in the charming west village neigborhood in Manhattan.

This is a personal site for me to write notes and any thoughts as I continue to learn about programming and data analysis. I find that this helps me better internalize what I learn. Also, a lot of written material here serve as reference for myself as I progress. 

Most of my time is spent writing code in Ruby and R. I feel that Ruby is very intuitive and is probably the most enjoyable language to code in. R is particularly useful as I often analyse time series data for my work in finance.

Some blogs I actively follow are:

* [Virtuous Code](http://devblog.avdi.org/)
* [Coding Horror](http://cloud.feedly.com/#subscription%2Ffeed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.feedburner.com%2Fcodinghorror%2F)
* [Martin Fowler](http://cloud.feedly.com/#subscription%2Ffeed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmartinfowler.com%2Ffeed.atom)
* [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)
* [Simply Statistics](http://cloud.feedly.com/#subscription%2Ffeed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fsimplystatistics.org%2Ffeed%2F)

Apart from the *VERY* serious work and programming I do, I like snowboarding, P90X and watching science fiction television/movies. 

Please drop me an email at jg@john-goh.com if you would like to chat.
